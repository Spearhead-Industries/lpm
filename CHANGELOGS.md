# Changelogs

## [1.3.0] - 27th Feburary 2024

### Added

- Added `lpm.is_standalone` function to the lpm builtin:
  - Returns `true` if the script is being executed as a standalone, returns false otherwise.
  - Although the `lpm` CLI is also a standalone lune programme, it will not be considered as one by this function.

### Changes

- `build` now carves out residual lpm bytecode in the resultant binary.

## [1.2.0] - 27th Feburary 2024

### Added

- `lpm` builtin with:
  - `create_binary` function to create a standalone binary from within LuaU.

### Changes

- Changed the internal build tool to use `lune-lpm` instead of vanilla lune.
  - `lune-lpm` is a patch of lune to enable process.args to be mutated and to allow standalones to be built fron inside LuaU.

- `run` now removes the first argument of process.args before handing over to the target script. This prevents 'run' from appearing in the target script's argument list.

## [1.1.0] - 26th Feburary 2024

### Added

- Added an `exclude` field to lpm-package.toml files.
  - Any exluded files *will* be downloaded with the rest of the repo and are instead removed *after* downloading.
  - Use .gitignore to hide sensitive information instead.
  - To prevent abuse, any double full-stops will be replaced with a single full-stop. Not that you should have multiple full-stops in a row in your filenames anyway as that looks ugly. üëç
  - All paths are prefixed with "./" automatically.

- Added support for wally and rotriever packages.
  - If no compatible package files are found, it will still install. You will need to figure out how to require it on your own however. Usually `require("@lpm/package/src")` will suffice.
  - Rotriever packages, if they have a valid `content_root` field, are requirable with the standard LPM `require("@lpm/package")` notation.
  - Wally dependencies are currently *not* supported, as I have yet to find an example of a wally package that has dependencies.
  - Any 'include' fields are ignored.

- The `install` and `uninstall` commands now remove any residual packages in the `lpm_modules` folder.
  - A package is deemed residual if it cannot be found in any (sub-)package `lpm-package.toml` dependencies.
  - This means that `uninstall` now correctly uninstalls sub-dependencies too.

- Added an `edit` subcommand to provide an interface to interact with your package metadata safely.

### Removed

- Removed _LPM from the `lpm run` environment.
- Removed Type Definitions for _LPM.

## [1.0.1] - 25th Feburary 2024

### Fixed

- Bug preventing temporary files from being removed after building.
